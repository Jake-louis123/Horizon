## The daily reminder: just one tiny win today.

> No missed doses, no messed plans. A health companion that's durable and easy to keep in your bag.

### ðŸ§  Our Philosophy

**Pact Case** was born from a simple idea - your health commitments should be easy to maintain. The name "pact" comes from a meaningful Chinese term describing someone who honors commitments and maintains self-discipline.

### ðŸ’Š Why Pact Case?

Most pharmacy pill boxes are forgettable, one-and-done, and a hassle to use. We've created something different:

- **Thoughtfully designed** for daily use and travel
- **Durable construction** that stands up to everyday life
- **Organized system** that makes medication management simple
- **Stylish appearance** you won't mind keeping visible

### ðŸŒ± Our Story

Inspired by grandfather Yang's wisdom about "pact-abiding" - honoring commitments while avoiding rigid constraints - we created a medication case that embodies gentle self-care:

> "A real pact should be a gentle commitment to ourselves, not a constraint."

Nobody wants to make a pact with medication - but life goes on. This case is your health pact, always on hand.
